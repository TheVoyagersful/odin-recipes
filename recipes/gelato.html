    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gelato, in italian literally meaning "frozen", refers to a specific type of ice cream of Italian origin.</p>
    <p>Artisanal gelato in Italy generally contains 6 to 9% butterfat, which is lower than other styles of frozen dessert.Gelato typically contains 35% air (substantially less than American-style ice cream) and more flavoring than other types of frozen desserts, giving it an intense flavor with creamy, smooth texture, density and richness that distinguishes it from other ice creams.</p>
