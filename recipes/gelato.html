        <h2 class="descriptiontitle">Description</h2>
        <p>Gelato, in Italian literally meaning "frozen", refers to a specific type of ice cream of Italian origin.</p>
        <p>Artisanal gelato in Italy generally contains 6 to 9% butterfat, which is lower than other styles of frozen dessert. Gelato typically contains 35% air (substantially less than American-style ice cream) and more flavoring than other types of frozen desserts, giving it an intense flavor with a creamy, smooth texture, density, and richness that distinguishes it from other ice creams.</p>
        <h2 class="ingredientstitle">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of milk</li>
            <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>4 egg yolks</li>
            <li>Â½ cup sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="preparationtitle">How to make it:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix milk and cream in a medium saucepan. Warm until foam forms around the edges. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar until frothy in a large bowl. Gradually pour warm milk into egg yolks and sugar, whisking constantly. Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for 2 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a sealed container, and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.</li>
